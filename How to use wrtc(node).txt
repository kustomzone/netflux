Netflux is using the wrtc node library to have WebRTC connections in the node environment.
To make sure that this library will work properly you have to install :

    python2
    git
    pkg-config
    libncurses-devel
    libssl-devel
    libnss-devel
    libexpat-devel

On Debian / Ubuntu, run :
apt-get install python2.7 git-all pkg-config libncurses5-dev libssl-dev libnss3-dev libexpat-dev

On CentOS / Fedora / RHEL, run :
yum install python git pkgconfig openssl-devel ncurses-devel nss-devel expat-devel
